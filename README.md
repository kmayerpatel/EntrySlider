# EntrySlider

EntrySlider example from lecture. Students are encouraged to read through comments.

It is left as an exercise to follow the pattern to create a ColorPicker out of 3 entry sliders representing red, green, and blue and to connect
changes to the color picker to updating the header's text color.
